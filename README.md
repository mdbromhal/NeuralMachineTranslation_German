# NeuralMachineTranslation_German
ABSTRACT: Using Neural Machine Translation to Translate Between German &amp; English

- Cleaning the data file
- Vectorizing each character (to help the model understand the characters: computers only understand numbers)
- Encoder & Decoder
- Training and predicting

Ex) "Hello, I am a student" --> '[UNK] ist ein [UNK]'
- Compared to Google translate: Hallo, ich bin Student!

- So, there are some improvements that need to be made, as discussed at the end of the ipynb file
